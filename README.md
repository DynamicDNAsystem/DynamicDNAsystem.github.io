# Interchange
Welcome to the D-DNA of MAN Network Interchange

This is where we share everything!

Our Mutual Aid Network of networks uses this space (GitHub.com) as our place to: 
- Express your needs
- Offer what you have to give 
- Create projects that fulfill needs by providing products & services to the community free of charge 
-Choose tasks to complete within projects to contribute your time to the community 
-Log your contribution of the requested 3 hours a week to the community 
- Collectively fund projects 
- Consensually select projects to be prioritized & focused on by the network, especially considering funding 
- Discuss the projects & ask questions and make suggestions and requests 
- Give feedback on our system, projects, and fellow Prosumer-Stewards to continuously improve our effectiveness 
- Track progress on projects and need fulfillment 
- And stay connected with us, your network!
